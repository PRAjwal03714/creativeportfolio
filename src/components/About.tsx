        I’m a Software Engineer with a strong focus on optimizing performance and enhancing user experiences. Currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Indiana University, I am continually expanding my knowledge and skills to stay at the forefront of the field.

Beyond my technical expertise, I have developed key leadership and teamwork abilities as the captain of my college cricket team. Strategic thinking, resilience, and the ability to collaborate effectively are core strengths I bring to every project, both in the tech world and beyond.        </p>
